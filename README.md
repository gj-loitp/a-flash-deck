# a-flash-deck

A simple Flash Card application to assist in learning and remembering something.

This project is intended for demo app for [a-navigator](https://github.com/rh-id/a-navigator) and [a-provider](https://github.com/rh-id/a-provider) library usage.
The app still works as production even though it is demo app.

## Project Structure

The app uses a-navigator framework as navigator and StatefulView as base structure,
combined with a-provider library for service locator,
and finally RxAndroid to handle UI use cases.
